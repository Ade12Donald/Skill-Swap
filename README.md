# Skill Swap 🎓

Learn together. Teach each other. Grow together.

_Target Audience: Students_

Education is expensive, and learning new skills often comes with financial barriers. But what if we could learn from one another by contributing our knowledge, talents, and abilities?

Skill Swap is a student-focused platform designed to make skill acquisition more accessible by connecting people who want to learn with people who are willing to teach. Through collaboration and knowledge sharing, students can exchange skills without necessarily exchanging money.

_Core Values: Contribution · Learning · Collaboration_

## ✨ Features

- User Profiles: Users create accounts specifying the skills they can teach and the skills they want to learn.
- Work Showcase: Users can showcase their work, projects, and practical experience.
- Skill Matching: Users discover people who can teach them and people who want to learn the skills they already possess.
- Collaboration Requests: Users send requests to potential learning partners, including their proposed terms and conditions.
- Flexible Scheduling: Learning partners arrange their own classes and agree on a schedule, with at least one session per week.
- Class Tracking: Sessions are tracked to encourage consistency and accountability.
- Ratings and Feedback: Users rate their sessions and learning partners. Ratings contribute to a scoring system that encourages active participation and commitment.
